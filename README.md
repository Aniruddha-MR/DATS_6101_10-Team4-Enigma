# Exercise and Fitness Metrics Analysis Proposal
### The US fitness industry is booming and expected to reach $434.74 billion by 2028. The demand for diverse workout options, personalized training, and innovative technologies is increasing due to a cultural shift towards a healthier lifestyle. This project aims to analyze a dataset of exercise and fitness metrics to identify patterns and trends for improving fitness programs and personalizing user workout regimens. The dataset from Kaggle contains 3865 observations and 11 features like Exercise, Calories-Burnt, Dream Weight, Actual Weight, Age, BMI, and Weather.

## SMART questions
### 1. How do age, actual weight, and duration collectively influence the relationship between exercise intensity and calorie burn?
### 2. Can we establish a time-based trend in the dataset, such as changes in exercise preferences, calorie expenditure, or weight measurements over time?
### 3. Do males and females exhibit different patterns in terms of exercise variety?
### 4. Are there exercises more commonly performed indoors or outdoors, depending on the weather?
### 5. Can the combination of heart rate and BMI be used to determine the optimal exercise duration for achieving dream weight?
### 6. How closely do individuals' dream weights align with their actual weights?
